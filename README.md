📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the level of awareness and utilization of government schemes among women entrepreneurs in India. Using structured questionnaires and survey-based data collection, the study evaluates financial, social, and procedural barriers that limit women’s participation in entrepreneurship despite the availability of multiple government initiatives.

📊 Methodology

🔍 Key Findings

💡 Impact
