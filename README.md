# Awareness of Government Schemes Among Women Entrepreneurs in India

## Project Overview
This project examines the level of awareness and utilization of government schemes among women entrepreneurs in India. Using survey-based primary data, the study evaluates financial, social, and procedural barriers that limit women’s participation in entrepreneurship despite the availability of multiple government initiatives.

## Methodology
- Primary data collection using two structured questionnaires  
- Respondent groups:
  - Women aspiring to start businesses  
  - Existing women MSME entrepreneurs  
- Data analysis techniques:
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Visual representations (charts and graphs)

## Key Findings
- Over 70% of aspiring women entrepreneurs lacked awareness of government schemes  
- Financial constraints emerged as the most significant barrier to entering entrepreneurship  
- Existing entrepreneurs showed moderate awareness but low satisfaction with scheme implementation  
- Procedural complexity and limited outreach reduced overall scheme effectiveness

## Impact
The study highlights a clear gap between policy intent and real-world outcomes. It emphasizes the need for improved awareness campaigns, simplified procedures, and data-driven implementation strategies to enhance the effectiveness of government schemes supporting women entrepreneurs.
